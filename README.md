# Github projects trello like cards

This extension makes the github projects page work like Trello does.

1 Click opens up the card inside a modal on the current page

2 Clicks will forward to the real page

Going to a link with a hash inside it will open the corresponding ticket.

These hashes can be ticket number or card id.
